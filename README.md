# esp32-uart-timer
ESP32 UART Stopwatch is a small embedded system project developed on an ESP32 microcontroller that functions as a stopwatch controlled via UART commands, with real-time display on an OLED screen and persistent data storage using an external EEPROM.

This project is designed not only to meet functional requirements, but also to serve as a complete engineering exercise following the V-Model development cycle, including:

🧩 Definition of system and software requirements

🏛️ Design of software architecture

🧱 Modular software component implementation

🧪 Development of unit tests and basic static analysis

🔗 Traceability between requirements, code, and tests

🔍 Final verification and validation to ensure correctness

This repository aims to demonstrate good practices in embedded software development, including documentation, modular design, version control, testing, and traceability.
